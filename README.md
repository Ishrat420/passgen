# passgen
Passgen is a minimalist, offline-friendly password generator that lets you create strong, consistent passwords using your own secret formula. 
Choose your hashing algorithm (SHA, MD5, Base64), bring your own salt, adjust the output length, and add a custom suffix all without storing a single thing.
